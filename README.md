# The Controller
## About

The Controller is just a Discord Bot with a few commands and functions to polish my server. You are free to view the code however you like. If you just happened to stumble across this repository, I would just like to kindly ask you to join my Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/c8n6mRT)
## Lost?
If you came here from the 'arcade help' command, just go into the file named 'commands' then 'help' and you should be back at where you were before.
