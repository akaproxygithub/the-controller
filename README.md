# The Controller

The Controller is just a Discord Bot with a few commands and functions to polish my server. You are free to view the code however you like, however if you were brought to the repository by the 'arcade help' command, go to the 'help' folder and you can find all the commands there.If you just happened to stumble across this repository, I would just lie to kindly ask you to join my Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/c8n6mRT)
